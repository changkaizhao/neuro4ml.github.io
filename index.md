title: Neuroscience for machine learners

# About

This is a freely available online course on neuroscience for people with a machine learning background.
The aim is to bring together these two fields that have a shared goal in understanding intelligent processes.
Rather than pushing for "neuroscience-inspired" ideas in machine learning, the idea is to broaden the
conceptions of both fields to incorporate elements of the other in the hope that this will lead to new,
creative thinking.

The course is given in person at the [Department for Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/), and made freely available online (although without the practical classes).

Each week there are a series of videos to watch on YouTube, and a set of exercises available as a Jupyter notebook that can be run locally or via Google Colab. Students at Imperial College can discuss on Teams, and for everyone else there is an open Discord server.

We hope you enjoy the course!
